CANOO SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengths
Innovation One of the key strengths of Canoo is continuous innovation which is supported by its strong R&D facilities which allows
it to develop unique products. The strong R&D helped in building strong Intellectual Property as Canoo has ongoing various patents
applications on its innovations.
One System Various Design The heart of the Canoo system is its “skateboard” architecture, which houses the batteries and the
electric drive train in a chassis underneath the vehicle’s cabin. All of the company’s vehicles will have the unconventional design that
takes advantage of the flatter structure, a skateboard platform, that will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle components
stacked atop it and a more significant cabin space for different applications centered around minimalism and functionality.
Technology Simplicity Canoo’s vehicle design embraces a harmony between the technology style and utility. Beneath this
exquisite design drivers will use their own phones or tablet devices as the vehicle’s primary interface to handle things like music
and navigation, and even to control the vehicle's heating and air conditioning using a downloadable app. to give
ultimate performance.
Sustainable Financially Subscribers would pay a monthly fee that could include registration costs, insurance, maintenance
and charging costs. Customers would keep their vehicle, as with a lease, but they wouldn't have to commit to a set time period. This
becomes really beneficial and hassle free for the drivers.
Value Rather than operating through retail auto dealers, Canoo will deal with customers directly using mobile apps and
websites to deliver an authentic experience. The company won't sell its cars should help it avoid the sort of legal conflicts with
established auto dealers.
Consumer focus Canoo designs its products with a focus on consumers while keeping their mind in the future. They always try to
imagine the things which even the consumer has not imagined yet. Canoo has developed breakhtrough electric vehicles, reinventing

the automotive landscape with bold innovations in design, pioneering technologies, and a unique business model that defies
traditional ownership to put customer first.
Weaknesses
Brand valuation Canoo is going public at a valuation of $2.4 billion in an effort to raise enough money to help bring its first
multi purpose vehicle ‘loft on wheels’, so the brand equity is currently low.
Matching Customer expectations Being one of the EV companies that went public, listed on the stock market has the consumer
expectation going through the roof. People expect great things year after year and maintaining these expectation levels is not easy
for anyone.
Dependency on few products Canoo has only 3 products in its portfolio set to launch in comparison to the various products that
its closest competitors on the EV market . Hence the dependency of Canoo on each of its products is very high. If one product fails,
then that is a high loss to the brand. Hence, there is a common demand from Canoo to increase its product portfolio.
Opportunities
Growth in Universal Consumer Electric Vehicle market Electric Vehicle Market is projected to reach 26,951,318 units by 2030
from an estimated 3,269,671 units in 2019, at a CAGR of 21.1% This is primarily driven by the concern over greenhouse gas emissions
and their contribution to global warming, dissatisfaction with the ICEV.
Reasearch&Development Worlwide for energy storage, infrastructure that provides new, green technologies, zero emissions and
improvements in battery technology.
Time Canoo has one more year ahead untill the first model to be launched on the market. Therfore, this time could be used to
produce and provide the elements and teqniques that were not yet ready before Covid19 impact and the initial launching date in
2021.

Location California is the state with the most aggressive deployment targets, with a goal to have 5 million EVs on the road by
2030. Other states have adopted goals for ZEV deployment, and provided rebates for ZEVs and incentives for ZEV infrastructure,
such as EV supply equipment (EVSE) infrastructure. Canoo has its headquarter located in Torrance, California.
Threats
Rapid changes in Technology: The company has to keep up its speed with the changes in technology. This requires a huge
investment in R&D and increases costs for Canoo.
Distribution Has its own production based in LA and Canoo will start offering its subscription vehicles in one geography and
scale slowly from there. The controlled expansion plans and modest goals for geographical reach could make difficult to become known
to clients on the markets.
Market penetration and competition One of the key threats to Canoo is the market penetration by other brands in the EV
market. ICEV currently dominates the global market share still the EV remains low on cutomer’s preference. There are also small
amount of consumers that decide to return to gas vehicle due to various personal reasons. The competition is ever-increasing in the
automotive market.
Commercial infrastructure The poor infrastructure of charging stations and service specialized staff represents currently a
decisive factor for customers when making an automobile choice based on their location area.
