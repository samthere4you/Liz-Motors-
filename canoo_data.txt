CANOO
 
SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengt
h
s
Innovation
 
One of the key strengths of Canoo is
 
continuous
 
innovation
 
which is supported by its strong R&D facilities which allow
s
it to develop
 
unique
 
products
.
 
The strong R&D helped in building strong Intellectual Property as Cano
o
 
has
 
ongoing
 
various patents
applications
 
on its innovations.
One
 
System Various
 
Design
 
The heart of the Canoo system is its “skateboard” architecture, which houses the batteries and the
electric drive
 
train in a chassis underneath the vehicle’s cabin. All of the company’s vehicles will have
 
the unconventional design that
takes advantage of the flatter structure, a skateboard platform, that will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle comp
onents
st
acked atop it and a more significant cabin space
 
for different applications
 
centered around minimalism and functionality
.
Technology
 
Simplicity
 
Canoo’s vehicle design embraces a harmony between
 
the technology
 
style and utility
.
 
B
eneath this
exquisite design
 
drivers will use their own phones or tablet devices
 
as the vehicle’s primary interface
 
to handle things like music
and
 
navigation, and even to control the vehicle's heating and air conditioning using a downloadable app.
 
to give
ultimate
 
performance
.
Sustainable
 
Financially
 
Subscribers would pay a monthly fee that could include registration costs, insurance, maintenance
and charging costs.
 
Customers would keep their vehicle, as with a lease, but they wouldn't have to commit to a
 
set time period.
 
This
becomes really beneficial and hassle free for the drivers.
Value
 
Rather than operating through retail auto dealers, Canoo will deal
 
with customers directly using mobile apps and
websites
 
to deliver an authentic experience
. The company won't sell its cars should help it avoid the sort of legal
 
conflict
s with
established auto dealers
.
Consumer
 
focus
 
Canoo
 
designs its
 
products
 
with a focus on consumers while keeping their mind in the future. They always try to
imagine the things which even the
 
consumer has not imagined yet
.
 
Canoo has developed break
h
trough electric vehicles, reinventing
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__
Gabriela Becheanu
the a
u
tomotive landscape with bold innovations in design, pioneering technologies, and a unique business model that defies
traditional ownership to put customer
 
first.
Weaknesses
B
rand valuation
 
Canoo
 
is going public at a valuation of $2.4 billion in an effort to raise enough money to help bring its first
multi purpose
 
vehicle
 
‘loft on wheels’
, so the brand equity is currently low
.
Matching
 
Customer expectations
 
Being
 
one of the EV
 
compan
ies that went public, listed on the stock market
 
has the
 
consumer
expectation
 
going through the roof. People expect great things year after year and maintaining these expectation levels is not easy
for anyone.
Dependency on few products
 
Canoo
 
has only
 
3
 
product
s
 
in its
 
portfolio
 
set
 
to launch
 
in comparison to the various products that
its closest competitors
 
on the EV market
 
. Hence the dependency of
 
Canoo
 
on each of its products is very high. If one product fa
ils,
then that is a
 
high
 
loss to
 
the brand
. Hence, there is a common
 
demand
 
from
 
Canoo
 
to increase its
 
product portfolio
.
Opportu
nities
Growth
 
in Universal Consumer Electric Vehicle
 
market
 
Electric
 
Vehicle
 
Market
 
is
 
projected to reach 26,951,318 units by 2030
from an estimated 3,269,671 units in 2019, at a CAGR of 21.1% This is primarily driven by
 
the concern over greenhouse gas emissions
and their contribution to global warming
, dissatisfaction with the ICEV
.
Reasear
ch&Development Worlwide
 
for energy storage, infrastructure that provides new, green technologies, zero emissions
 
and
improvements in battery technology.
Time
 
Canoo has one more year ahead untill the first model to be launched on the market.
 
Therfore, this time could be used to
produce and provide the elements and teqniques that were not yet ready before Covid19 impact and the initial launching date i
n
2021.

Canoo Competition Correlation Matrix
Typically, diversification allows investors to combine positions across different asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk. Correlation between Canoo and its competitors represents the degree of relationship between the price movements of corresponding stocks. A correlation of about +1.0 implies that the price of Canoo and its corresponding peer move in tandem. A correlation of -1.0 means that prices move in opposite directions. A correlation of close to zero suggests that the price movements of assets are uncorrelated; in other words, the historical price movement of Canoo Inc does not affect the price movement of the other competitor.

Analyst Perspectives on Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV): An Investment Evaluation
Dec 27, 2023
 | 
Stock Analysis
Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment.
 
 
Analyst Ratings and Price Targets
As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges.
However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% (
Yahoo Finance
). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance.
Market Sentiment and Competitive Landscape
The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards.
In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts.
Financial Overview and Future Potential
Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers.
It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets.
Conclusion
Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment.
Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

Electric Vehicle Trends
An increasing number of governments and businesses are pledging to achieve carbon neutrality within the next few decades. The electrification of vehicles is a big component of this plan.

What are the latest vehicle electrification trends?
How will the automotive industry contribute to the global goal of carbon neutrality?  


































The auto industry's transition to EVs is accelerating. The year 2026 has emerged as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption that will drive automotive electrification trends ahead. By 2030 over one in four new passenger cars sold will be an electric vehicle. Many major vehicle manufacturers worldwide have signaled the end of an era of internal combustion engines (ICE) as the transition to zero emission vehicles (ZEV) is ramped up.
The top automakers are expected to account for more than 70% of global EV production by the year 2030 (compared to 2022 when they represented only 10% of all EV manufacturers). But despite the rapidly growing choices EV consumers have, and the unprecedented loyalty rates among EV return buyers, the industry as a whole still needs to tackle consumers range anxiety, particular for those without a garage or those traveling long distances.
The solution needs to be a joint effort between multiple industries: automotive, utilities, government, and private property owners such as shopping malls and apartment complexes. As these paths converge, vehicle electrification trends will increase exponentially. And we may, indeed, see the end of the ICE-age.

Electric cars had a record year in 2020, with Europe overtaking China as the biggest market






Global
After a decade of rapid growth, in 2020 the global electric car stock hit the 10 million mark, a 43% increase over 2019, and representing a 1% stock share. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million. 
Overall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about 
one-third
 from the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020.
About 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars.
Numerous factors
 contributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis. 
Several governments provided or extended fiscal incentives
 that buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets. 
Europe
Overall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands. 
This surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the 
European Union’s CO
2
 emissions standards
 that limit the average carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European 
governments increased subsidy schemes
 for EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic.
In European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%).
China
The overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%. 
Registration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered.  
Key policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic, 
several cities relaxed car licence policies
, allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries. 
United States
The US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations, 
reaching their limit
.
Other countries
Electric car markets in other countries
 were resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000. 
New Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown.
Another exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share.














Consumer spending on EVs continues to rise, while government support stabilises






Consumer spending
Consumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV. 
Government spending
Governments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020.
All the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many 
countries responded to the pandemic
-induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened.
An important novelty in subsidy schemes was the 
introduction of price caps in Europe
 
and China
, i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper.

Automakers entice customers with a wide menu including electric SUV models






Worldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled.
BEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level.
The average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years.
The widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons:
SUVs are the fastest growing market segment in Europe and China, and by far the largest market share in the United States. 
SUVs command higher prices and generally offer higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. This means OEMs find it easier to bear the extra costs of electrification for SUVs since the powertrain accounts for a smaller share of the total cost compared with a small car.
Electrifying the heaviest and most fuel consuming vehicles
 goes further toward meeting emissions targets than electrifying a small car. 
In Europe, 
the ZLEV credit scheme in the most recent CO
2
 emissions standards
 offers strong incentives for selling electric SUVs from 2025, as it relaxes emissions standards in proportion to their potential to reduce specific CO
2
 emissions. In fact, in Europe, the share of electric SUV models is higher than for the overall market.














China leads in electric LCV sales with Europe not far behind and Korea entering the market






Global electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader. 
Electric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%. 
In Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by 
CO
2
 standards
 that limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars.
Registration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs.
The explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about 
air pollution
, particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced 
plans to electrify delivery fleets
.

Manufacturers’ electrification targets align with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario






OEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs).
A number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond 
previous announcements
 related to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond.
Significantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included: 
Volvo will only sell electric cars from 2030
; 
Ford will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030
; 
General Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035
; 
Volkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030
; 
and Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States
.
Overall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV 
projections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario
. By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario.

        Trends and developments in electric heavy-duty vehicles
    














Electric bus and truck registrations expanded in major markets in 2020






Electric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000.
Bus registrations 
China continues to dominate the 
electric bus market
, with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force. 
Electric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding 
European Clean Bus Deployment Initiative
 and demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies. 
In North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020.
Heavy-duty truck registrations 
Global electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both.

Electric heavy-duty vehicle models are broadening






The availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) models is expanding in leading global markets.
1
 Buses were the earliest and most successful case of electrification in the HDV market, but the growing demand for electric trucks is pushing manufacturers to broaden product lines. Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations.
The growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as 
Daimler
, 
MAN
, 
Renault
, 
Scania
 and 
Volvo
 have indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs.
The HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models.

Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative update on private sector commitments






Despite a turbulent year, major companies around the world are accelerating the transition to electric mobility by shifting fleets to electric vehicles and installing charging stations.
The Climate Group’s 
EV100 Initiative
 brings together over 100 companies in 80 markets committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030.
Collectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks. 
EV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations.
Significant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs.
To help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.

Battery demand lagged EV sales in 2020; Europe sees highest rise in demand






Automotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity.
China accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh.
Nickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market. 
According to the 
BNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices,
 the weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by 
teardown analysis
 of a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells.
In Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but 
announced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025
. Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the 
European Investment Bank
. In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large 
investments
 in a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture.

Pandemic spreads popularity of electric micromobility






Electric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility. 
Sales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled
 in 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%.
Many shared micromobility operators reduced or 
suspended services
 during the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with 
270 cities worldwide relaunching operations
. As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020.
Preliminary data from operators indicate 
average trip distances on e-scooters have increased
 by around 25% relative to 
before the pandemic
. Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to 
expand into electric mopeds
, which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit. 
Several major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of 
swappable batteries
 increases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles.
Privately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives.

Korea takes a lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles






Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs. 
To address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks. 
In 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks. 
In 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020. Worldwide the number of HRS increased 15%.

Installation of publicly accessible chargers expanded sevenfold in the last five years; Covid-19 muted the pace in 2020 while China still leads






While most charging of EVs is done at home and work, roll-out of publicly accessible charging will be critical as countries leading in EV deployment enter a stage where simpler and improved autonomy will be demanded by EV owners. Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers. 
Slow chargers
The pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers.
Europe is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020. 
Installation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place. 
Fast chargers
The pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment.
In Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers. 
Publicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle.














Most countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers






European countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the 
Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive
 (AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries.
AFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020.
In the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy.
Countries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can 
largely use private home charging
. To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark.

Planning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking






The roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020. 
HFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate 
standardisation
.   
Megachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the 
high power requirements
 of megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed. 
Some efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an 
ultra-high power charging standard
 (up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative 
established a task force
 called the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the 
combined charging system (CCS) standard
. Prototype testing started in 
September 2020
. Tesla 
announced in late 2020
 that it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN. 
Industry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs.
There are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with 
stimulus funding
, Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an 
open-access test centre for companies and academia
 that offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the 
West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative
 aims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.

CO2 emissions exert a profound influence on climate and the environment, fueling the greenhouse effect and contributing significantly to global climate change. Nearly one-fourth of these emissions worldwide can be attributed to the transportation sector. Electric vehicles (EVs) emerge as a promising solution, potentially acting as a carbon-neutral alternative when powered by renewable energy sources. This underscores their pivotal role in mitigating the impact of traditional combustion engine vehicles on the environment.
The Electric Vehicles market includes information about electric vehicles in countries where, according to our sources, a public electric vehicle charging infrastructure is already available. In this context, “public” means that people have unrestricted access to the charging infrastructure. A vehicle can be defined as electric if it is self-contained with a battery or classified as a plug-in hybrid. All key figures shown represent the sales of new cars, and their basic configuration in the respective year. The figures do not include the sale of used vehicles nor adapted equipment for the new cars sold. The prices and revenues shown are accordingly based on the basic models.
The Electric Vehicle market is divided into distinct two distinct markets, namely Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). This categorization allows for a nuanced understanding of the market dynamics, considering the specific attributes and market penetration of each electric vehicle type. The emphasis on new car sales and their foundational configurations ensures clarity, while the exclusion of used vehicles and customizations maintains focus on the evolving landscape of electric vehicles.

It is safe to say that battery-powered vehicles are taking over the automobile market. The growth of the Electric Vehicles (EV) market has been significant despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting supply chain bottlenecks. Despite these recent challenges and rising production costs as a result of increasing raw material prices, EV sales are still going up at a fast rate. If this continues, they are set to surpass the sales of conventionally propelled vehicles (i.e., vehicles with internal combustion engines) . Compared to 2020, sales of new electric vehicles more than doubled in 2021 with an increase of 108%. This brought EV sales to about 5% of global passenger car sales in 2021. 


China conveniently topped the global sales charts in 2021 with more electric vehicles sold than the rest of the world combined and almost five times more than Germany, which was in second place. Factors responsible for the Chinese market’s exponential growth include, but are not limited to, the Chinese government’s electric vehicle subsidies, an increasing range of mini electric vehicles, and more affordable brands coming onto the market. Overall, Europe recorded an increase between 2020 and 2021, reaching about 66%, with the plug-in hybrid share of all electric vehicle sales being the biggest in the world. Driven by the availability of more models, as well as the market expansion and purchase incentives, the European market is expected to continue along this trend as countries within the EU  adopt stricter CO2 emission standards and move toward zero-emissions vehicle mandates.


Regardless of the tremendous growth in the Electric Vehicles market, it is only limited to a part of the world. As the race to full electrification continues, China , Europe, and the U.S. account for about 95% of the global electric vehicle sales, whereas the rest of the world seems to struggle with catching up. In addition to government subsidies just getting introduced or still being nonexistent, the top reasons cited for the slow progress experienced in those parts of the world include the lack of public charging infrastructure and the premium prices of electric vehicles in these regions.

Electric car sales
1
 saw another record year in 2022, despite supply chain disruptions, macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and high commodity and energy prices. The growth in electric car sales took place in the context of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022 dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales – including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) – exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021.
2
 This figure – 10 million EV sales worldwide – exceeds the total number of cars sold across the entire European Union (about 9.5 million vehicles) and is nearly half of the total number of cars sold in China in 2022. In the course of just five years, from 2017 to 2022, EV sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It previously took five years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow from 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential nature of EV sales growth. The share of electric cars in total car sales jumped from 9% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, more than 10 times their share in 2017.














Over 26 million electric cars were on the road in 2022, up 60% relative to 2021 and more than 5 times the stock in 2018






Increasing sales pushed the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads to 26 million, up 60% relative to 2021, with BEVs accounting for over 70% of total annual growth, as in previous years. As a result, about 70% of the global stock of electric cars in 2022 were BEVs. The increase in sales from 2021 to 2022 was just as high as from 2020 to 2021 in absolute terms – up 3.5 million – but relative growth was lower (sales doubled from 2020 to 2021). The exceptional boom in 2021 may be explained by EV markets catching up in the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Seen in comparison to recent years, the annual growth rate for electric car sales in 2022 was similar to the average rate over 2015-2018, and the annual growth rate for the global stock of electric cars in 2022 was similar to that of 2021 and over the 2015-2018 period, showing a robust recovery of EV market expansion to pre-pandemic pace.

Half of the world’s electric cars are in China






The increase in electric car sales varied across regions and powertrains, but remains dominated by the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). In 2022, BEV sales in China increased by 60% relative to 2021 to reach 4.4 million, and PHEV sales nearly tripled to 1.5 million. The faster growth in PHEV sales relative to BEVs warrants further examination in the coming years, as PHEV sales still remain lower overall and could be catching up on the post-Covid-19 boom only now; BEV sales in China tripled from 2020 to 2021 after moderate growth over 2018-2020. Electric car sales increased even while total car sales dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021.
China accounted for nearly 60% of all new electric car registrations globally. For the first time in 2022, China accounted for more than 50% of all the electric cars on the world’s roads, a total of 13.8 million. This strong growth results from more than a decade of sustained policy support for early adopters, including an 
extension of purchase incentives
 initially planned for phase-out in 2020 to the end of 2022 due to Covid-19, in addition to non-financial support such as rapid roll-out of charging infrastructure and stringent registration policies for non-electric cars.
In 2022, the share of electric cars in total domestic car sales reached 29% in China, up from 16% in 2021 and under 6% between 2018 and 2020. China has therefore 
achieved
 its 2025 national target of a 20% sales share for so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs)
3
 well in advance. All indicators point to further growth: although the national NEV sales target is yet to be updated by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which is responsible for the automotive industry, the objective of greater road transport electrification is re-affirmed in multiple strategy documents. China aims to reach a 
50%
 sales share by 2030 in so-called “key air pollution control regions”, and 
40%
 across the country by 2030 to support the national action plan for carbon peaking. If recent market trends continue, China’s 2030 targets may also be reached ahead of time. Provincial governments are also supporting adoption of NEVs, with 18 provinces to date having set NEV targets. 
Support at the regional level in China has also helped to advance some of the world’s largest EV makers. Shenzhen-based BYD has supplied most of the city’s electric buses and taxis, and its leading position is also reflected in Shenzhen’s ambition of reaching a 
60%
 NEV sales share by 2025. Guangzhou, which has a 50% NEV sales share by 2025 target, 
facilitated
 the expansion of Xpeng Motors to become one of the national EV frontrunners.

Whether China’s electric car sales share will remain significantly above the 20% target in 2023 remains uncertain, as sales may have been especially high in anticipation of incentives being phased out at the end of 2022. Sales in January 2023 
plunged
, and while this is in part due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, they were nearly 10% lower than sales in January 2022. However, electric car sales caught up in February and March 2023, standing nearly 60% above sales in February 2022 and more than 25% above sales in March 2022, thereby bringing sales in the first quarter of 2023 more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022.














Growth remained steady in Europe despite disruptions






In Europe,
4
 electric car sales increased by more than 15% in 2022 relative to 2021 to reach 2.7 million. Sales grew more quickly in previous years: annual growth stood at more than 65% in 2021 and averaged 40% over 2017-2019. In 2022, BEV sales rose by 30% relative to 2021 (compared to 65% growth in 2021 relative to 2020) while PHEV sales dipped by around 3%. Europe accounted for 10% of global growth in new electric car sales. Despite slower growth in 2022, electric car sales are still increasing in Europe in the context of continued contraction in car markets: total car sales in Europe dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021.
The 
slowdown
 seen in Europe relative to previous years was, in part, a reflection of the exceptional growth in electric car sales that took place in 2020 and 2021 in the European Union, as manufacturers quickly adjusted corporate strategy to comply with the CO
2
 emission 
standards
 passed in 2019. These standards covered the 2020-2024 period, with EU-wide emission targets becoming stricter only from 2025 and 2030 onwards. 
High energy prices in 2022 had a mixed impact on the competitiveness of EVs relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Gasoline and diesel prices for ICE cars spiked, but residential electricity tariffs (with relevance for charging) also increased in some cases. Higher electricity and gas prices also increased manufacturing costs for both ICE and EV cars, with some carmakers arguing that high energy prices could 
restrict
 future investment for new battery manufacturing capacity.
Europe remained the world’s second largest market for electric cars after China in 2022, accounting for 25% of all electric car sales and 30% of the global stock. The sales share of electric cars reached 21%, up from 18% in 2021, 10% in 2020 and under 3% prior to 2019. European countries continued to rank highly for the sales share of electric cars, led by Norway at 88%, Sweden at 54%, the Netherlands at 35%, Germany at 31%, the United Kingdom at 23% and France at 21% in 2022. In volume terms, Germany is the biggest market in Europe with sales of 830 000 in 2022, followed by the United Kingdom with 370 000 and France with 330 000. Sales also exceeded 80 000 in Spain. The share of electric cars in total car sales has increased tenfold in Germany since before the Covid-19 pandemic, which can in part be explained by increasing support post-pandemic, such as purchase incentives through the 
Umweltbonus
, and a frontloading of sales in 2022 in 
expectation
 of subsidies being further reduced from 2023 onwards. However, in Italy, electric car sales decreased from 140 000 in 2021 to 115 000 in 2022, and they also decreased or stagnated in Austria, Denmark and Finland.

Sales are expected to continue increasing in Europe, especially following 
recent policy
 developments under the ‘Fit for 55’ package. New rules set stricter CO
2
 emission standards for 2030-2034 and target a 100% reduction in CO
2
 emissions for new cars and vans from 2035 relative to 2021 levels. In the nearer term, an incentive mechanism operating between 2025 and 2029 will reward manufacturers that achieve a 25% car sales share of zero- and low-emission cars (17% for vans). In the first two months of 2023, battery electric car sales were already 
up
 by over 30% year-on-year, while overall car sales increased by just over 10% year-on-year.














The United States confirms return to growth






In the United States, electric car sales increased 55% in 2022 relative to 2021, led by BEVs. Sales of BEVs increased by 70%, reaching nearly 800 000 and confirming a second consecutive year of strong growth after the 2019-2020 dip. Sales of PHEVs also grew, albeit by only 15%. The increase in electric car sales was particularly high in the United States, considering that total car sales dropped by 8% in 2022 relative to 2021, a much sharper decrease than the global average (minus 3%). Overall, the United States accounted for 10% of the global growth in sales. The total stock of electric cars reached 3 million, up 40% relative to 2021 and accounting for 10% of the global total. The share of electric cars in total car sales reached nearly 8%, up from just above 5% in 2021 and around 2% between 2018 and 2020.
A number of factors are helping to increase sales in the United States. A greater number of available models, beyond those offered by Tesla, the historic leader, helped to close the 
supply
 gap. Given that major companies like Tesla and General Motors had already reached their subsidy cap under US support in previous years,
5
 new models from other companies being available means that more consumers can benefit from purchase incentives, which can be as high as USD 7 500. Awareness is increasing as government and companies lean towards electrification: in 2022, a quarter of Americans expect that their next car will be electric, 
according
 to the American Automobile Association. Although charging infrastructure and driving range have improved over the years, they remain major 
concerns
 for US drivers given the typically long travel distances and lower popularity and limited availability of alternatives such as rail. However, in 2021 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law strengthened support for EV charging, allocating USD 5 billion in total funding over the 2022-2026 period through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, as well as USD 2.5 billion in competitive grants over the same period through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program.

The acceleration in sales growth could continue in 2023 and beyond thanks to recent new 
policy
 support (see 
Prospects for electric vehicle deployment
). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has triggered a 
rush by global electromobility companies
 to expand US manufacturing operations. Between August 2022 and March 2023, major EV and battery makers announced cumulative post-IRA investments of 
USD 52 billion
 in North American EV supply chains, of which 50% is for battery manufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV manufacturing. Overall, company announcements including tentative commitments for US investments for future battery and EV production add up to around 
USD 75-108 billion
. As an example, Tesla plans to 
relocate
 its Berlin-based lithium-ion battery gigafactory to Texas, where it will work in 
partnership
 with China’s CATL, and to manufacture next-generation EVs 
in Mexico
. Ford also announced a 
deal with CATL
 for a battery plant in Michigan, and 
plans
 to increase electric car manufacturing sixfold by the end of 2023 relative to 2022, at 600 000 vehicles per year, scaling up to 2 million by 2026. BMW is seeking to 
expand
 EV manufacturing at its plant in South Carolina following the IRA. Volkswagen chose Canada for its 
first battery plant outside Europe
, which will begin operations in 2027, and is also investing USD 2 billion in its plant in South Carolina. While these investments can be expected to lead to high growth in the years to come, the impact may only fully be seen from 2024 onwards as plants come online.
In the immediate term, the IRA has 
constrained
 eligibility requirements for purchase incentives, as vehicles need to be produced in North America in order to qualify for a subsidy. However, electric car sales have remained strong since August 2022, and the first months of 2023 have been no exception: In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales increased 60% compared to the same period in 2022, potentially boosted by the January 2023 removal of the subsidy caps for manufacturers, which means models by market leaders can now benefit from purchase incentives. In the longer-term, the list of models eligible for subsidies is expected to expand. 




















The 2023 outlook for electric cars is bright






Early indications from first quarter sales of 2023 point to an upbeat market, supported by cost declines as well as strengthened policy support in key markets such as the United States. Globally, our current estimate is therefore for nearly 14 million electric cars to be sold in 2023, building on the more than 2.3 million already sold in the first quarter of the year. This represents a 35% increase in electric car sales in 2023 compared to 2022 and would bring the global electric sales share to around 18%, up from 14% in 2022. 
Electric car sales in the first three months of 2023 have shown strong signs of growth compared to the same period in 2022. In the United States, more than 320 000 electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2023, 60% more than over the same period in 2022. Our current expectation is for this growth to be sustained throughout the year, with electric car sales reaching over 1.5 million in 2023, bringing the electric car sales share in the United States up to around 12% in 2023.
In China, electric car sales were off to a rough start in 2023, with January sales being 8% lower than in January 2022. The latest available data suggests a quick recovery: over the entire first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in China were more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022, with more than 1.3 million electric cars being registered. For the remainder of 2023, we expect the generally favourable cost structure of electric cars to outweigh the effects of the phase-out of the NEV subsidy. As a result, our current expectation is for electric car sales in China to be more than 30% higher than in 2022 and reach around 8 million by the end of 2023, reaching a sales share of over 35% (from 29% in 2022).
Based on recent trends and tightening CO
2
 targets not going into effect until 2025, the growth of electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in Europe increased by around 10% compared to the same period in 2022. For the full year, we currently expect electric car sales to increase by over 25%, with one-in-four cars sold in Europe being electric. 
Outside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to reach around 900 000 in 2023 – 50% higher than in 2022. Electric car sales in India in the first quarter of 2023 are already double what they were in the same period in 2022. In India and across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent 2-3% of car sales in 2023, a relatively small yet growing share.
There are, of course, downside risks to the 2023 outlook: a sluggish global economy and the phase-out of subsidies for NEVs in China could reduce 2023 growth in global electric car sales. On the upside, new markets may open up more quickly than anticipated, as persistent high oil prices make the case for EVs stronger in an increasing number of settings. And new policy developments, such as the April 2023 proposal from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen GHG emissions standards for cars, may send signals that boost sales even before going into effect. 















        Electric car models
    














The number of electric car models rises, especially for large cars and SUVs, at the same time as it decreases for conventional cars






The race to electrification is increasing the number of electric car models available on the market. In 2022, the number of available options reached 500, up from below 450 in 2021 and more than doubling relative to 2018-2019. As in previous years, China has the broadest portfolio with nearly 300 available models, double the number available in 2018-2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. This remains nearly twice as many as in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom, which all have around 150 models available, more than three times as many as before the pandemic. In the United States, there were fewer than 100 models available in 2022, but twice as many as before the pandemic; and 30 or fewer were available in Canada, Japan and Korea.

The 2022 trend reflects the increasing maturity of EV markets and demonstrates that carmakers are responding to increasing consumer demand for electric cars. However, the number of electric car models available remains much lower than that of conventional ICE cars, which has remained above 1 250 since 2010 and peaked at 1 500 in the middle of the past decade. In recent years, the number of ICE models sold has been steadily 
decreasing
, at a compound annual growth rate of minus 2% over the 2016-2022 period, reaching about 1 300 models in 2022. This dip varies across major car markets and is most pronounced in China, where the number of available ICE options was 8% lower in 2022 than in 2016, versus 3-4% lower in the United States and Europe over the same period. This could result from contracting car markets and a progressive shift towards EVs among major carmakers. Looking forward, the total number of ICE models available could remain stable, while the number of 
new models
 shrinks, if carmakers focus on electrification and keep selling existing ICE options rather than increasing budgets to develop new models.
In contrast to ICE models, EV model availability has been growing quickly, at a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the 2016-2022 period. Such growth is to be expected in a nascent market with a large number of new entrants bringing innovative products to the market, and as incumbents diversify their portfolios. Growth has been slightly lower in recent years: the annual growth rate stood at around 25% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. In the future, the number of models can be expected to continue to increase quickly, as major carmakers expand their EV portfolios and new entrants strengthen their positions, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The historic number of ICE models available on the market suggests that the current number of EV options could double, at least, before stabilising.

SUVs and large car models dominate both EV and ICE markets






A major concern for global car markets – both EV and ICE – is the overwhelming dominance of SUVs and large models among available options. Carmakers are able to generate higher revenues from such models, given higher profit margins, which can cover some of the investments made in developing electric options. In certain cases, such as in the United States, larger vehicles can also benefit from less stringent fuel economy standards, hence creating an incentive for carmakers to slightly increase the vehicle size of a car for it to qualify as a light truck.
However, large models are more expensive, which poses significant affordability issues across the board, and all the more so in EMDEs. Large models also have implications for sustainability and supply chains, being equipped with larger batteries that require more critical minerals. In 2022, the sales-weighted average battery size of small battery electric cars ranged from 25 kWh in China to 35 kWh across France, Germany and the United Kingdom, and about 60 kWh in the United States. In comparison, the average for battery electric SUVs was around 70-75 kWh in these countries, and within the 75-90 kWh range for large car models. 
Transitioning
 from ICE to electric is a priority for achieving net zero emissions targets, regardless of vehicle size, but mitigating the impacts of higher battery sizes will also be important. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2022, the sales-weighted average weight of a battery electric SUV was 1.5 times higher than the average small battery electric car, requiring greater amounts of steel, aluminium and plastic; the battery in the SUV was twice as large, requiring about 75% more critical minerals. The CO
2
 emissions associated with materials processing, manufacturing and assembly can be estimated at more than 70% higher as a result.
At the same time, in 2022, electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels per day of oil consumption and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines. Although electric SUVs represented roughly 35% of all electric passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) in 2022, their share of oil displacement was even higher (about 40%), as SUVs tend to be driven more than smaller cars. Of course, smaller vehicles generally require less energy to operate and less materials to build, but electric SUVs certainly remain favourable to ICE vehicles.
In 2022, ICE SUVs 
emitted
 more than 1 Gt CO
2
, far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year. While total car sales decreased by 0.5% in 2022, SUV sales increased by 3% relative to 2021, accounting for about 45% of total car sales, with noticeable growth in the United States, India and Europe. Of the 1 300 available options for ICE cars in 2022, more than 40% were SUVs, compared to fewer than 35% for small and medium cars. The total number of available ICE options went down from 2016 to 2022, but the drop was only for small and medium cars (down 35%) while large cars and SUVs increased (up 10%).
Similar trends are observed in EV markets. Around 16% of all SUVs sold were electric in 2022, which is above the overall market share of EVs and demonstrates consumer preferences for SUVs regardless of whether they are an ICE vehicle or EV. Nearly 40% of all BEV models available in 2022 were SUVs, which is equivalent to the shares of small and medium car options combined. Other large models accounted for more than 15%. Just 3 years before, in 2019, small and medium models accounted for 60% of all available models, and SUVs just 30%. 
In China and Europe, SUVs and large models accounted for 60% of available BEV options in 2022, on par with the world average. As a comparison, ICE SUVs and large models accounted for about 70% of available ICE options in these regions, suggesting that electric cars currently remain somewhat smaller than their ICE equivalents. Announcements by some major European carmakers indicate that there could be a greater focus on smaller, more popular models in the years to come. For example, 
Volkswagen
 has announced the launch of a compact model for the European market under EUR 25 000 by 2025 and under EUR 20 000 by 2026-2027, as a means to appeal to a broader consumer base. In the United States, over 80% of available BEV options in 2022 were SUVs or large car models, which is greater than the share of ICE SUVs or large models at 70%. Looking ahead, more electric SUVs are to be expected in the United States, should recent policy announcements on 
expansion
 of IRA incentives to more SUVs be implemented. Following the IRA, the US Treasury has been 
revising
 vehicle classifications, and in 2023 changed the eligibility criteria for clean vehicle credits relevant to smaller SUVs, which are now eligible if priced under USD 80 000, up from the previous limit of USD 55 000.














Electric cars remain much cheaper in China






The growth in electric car sales in China has been underpinned by sustained policy support, but also cheaper retail prices. In 2022, the sales-weighted average price of a small BEV in China was below USD 10 000. This is significantly less than the prices of small BEVs found in Europe and the United States, where the sales-weighted average price exceeded USD 30 000 in the same year. 
In China, the best-selling electric cars in 2022 were the Wuling Mini BEV, a small model priced at under USD 6 500, and BYD’s Dolphin, another small model, below USD 16 000. Together, these two models accounted for nearly 15% of Chinese BEV passenger car sales, illustrating the appetite for smaller models. To compare, the best-selling small BEVs across France, Germany and the United Kingdom – Fiat’s 500, Peugeot’s e-208 and Renault’s Zoe – were all priced above USD 35 000. Few small BEVs were sold in the United States, limited mainly to Chevrolet’s Bolt and the Mini Cooper BEV, which are priced around USD 30 000. Tesla’s Y Model was the best-selling BEV passenger car in both the selected European countries (priced at more than USD 65 000) and the United States (more than USD 50 000).

Chinese carmakers have focused on developing smaller and more affordable models in advance of their international peers, cutting down costs following years of tough competition domestically. Hundreds of small EV manufacturers have entered the market since the 2000s, benefitting from a variety of public support schemes, including subsidies and incentives for both consumers and manufacturers. The majority of these firms went bankrupt due to competition as subsidies were gradually phased out, and the market has since consolidated around a dozen frontrunners, which have succeeded in developing small and cheap electric cars for the Chinese market. Vertical integration of battery and EV supply chains from mineral processing to battery and EV manufacturing, as well as cheaper labour, manufacturing and access to finance across the board, have also contributed to developing cheaper models.
Meanwhile, carmakers in Europe and the United States – both early developers such as Tesla and incumbent major manufacturers – have mostly focused on larger or more luxurious models to date, hence offering few options affordable for mass-market consumers. However, the small options available in these countries typically offer greater performance than those in China, such as longer driving range. In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China. For other segments, the differences are less significant. The broader availability of public charging points in China may, in part, explain why consumers there have been more willing to opt for lower driving ranges than their European or American counterparts.
In 2022, Tesla heavily reduced the price of its models on two occasions as competition increased, and many carmakers have also announced cheaper options in the coming years. While these announcements warrant further examination, this trend could indicate that the price gap between small electric cars and incumbent ICE options could progressively close during this decade.

Emerging markets see encouraging growth






China, Europe and the United States – the three major markets for electric cars – accounted for about 95% of global sales in 2022. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) outside China account for only a fraction of the global electric car market. Demand for electric cars has increased in recent years, but sales remain low.
While EMDEs often quickly adopt low-cost emerging technology products (e.g. smartphones, computers and connected devices), electric cars remain typically too expensive for the majority of the population. According to a 
recent survey
, over 50% of Ghanaian respondents would prefer to purchase an EV to an ICE vehicle, but more than half of those potential consumers would not be willing to spend more than USD 20 000 for an electric car. Lack of access to reliable and affordable charging can be a barrier, as can limited access to EV servicing, maintenance and repair. In most EMDEs, road transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, which have seen much greater success in terms of electrification, as well as shared mobility for regional commutes. Purchasing behaviour is also different, with lower personal car ownership rates and more common purchase of used cars. Looking forward, while sales of electric cars – both new and used – can be expected to increase in EMDEs, it is likely that many countries will continue to rely primarily on two- and three-wheelers (see subsequent section on these vehicles in this report).
There was a notable boom in electromobility in 2022 in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled relative to 2021, reaching nearly 80 000. Sales in 2022 were 7 times higher than in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast, sales in other EMDEs were lower.
In India, BEV sales reached nearly 50 000 in 2022, 4 times more than in 2021, while total car sales increased by just below 15%. Leading domestic manufacturer Tata accounted for over 85% of BEV sales, including through sales of its small BEV Tigor/Tiago, which quadrupled. Indian PHEV sales remained close to zero. Burgeoning electromobility companies are now betting on the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme – with around USD 2 billion in subsidy programmes – to ramp up EV and component manufacturing. This scheme has 
attracted
 investments totalling USD 8.3 billion. 
The Indian market, however, currently remains geared towards shared and smaller mobility. In 2022, 
25%
 of electric car purchases in India were by fleet operators, such as for taxis. In early 2023, Tata secured a large 
order
 from Uber for 25 000 electric cars. Furthermore, while 55% of three-wheelers sold were electric, fewer than 2% of cars sold were EVs. 
Ola
, India’s top EV company by revenue, does not yet offer electric cars. Ola is instead concentrating on smaller mobility and 
aims
 to double its electric two-wheeler manufacturing capacity to 2 million by the end of 2023, and to reach an annual production capacity of 10 million between 2025 and 2028. The company also seeks to build lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities, initially at 5 GWh capacity, scaling up to 100 GWh by 2030. Ola aims to start marketing electric cars for its taxi business by 2024 and to make its fleet of taxis fully electric by 2029, while launching its own electric car business for both the high-end and mass markets. It 
announced
 over USD 900 million of investments for battery and EV manufacturing in Southern India, and an increase in annual production from 100 000 to 140 000 vehicles.

In Thailand, electric car sales doubled to 21 000, equally distributed between BEVs and PHEVs. The emerging presence of Chinese carmakers has accelerated EV adoption in the country. In 2021, Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
Great Wall Motors
 launched its Ora Good Cat BEV model in the Thai market, and in 2022 it became the most sold electric car in Thailand, with nearly 4 000 sales. The second and third best-selling cars were also Chinese, manufactured by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), none of which were sold in the country in 2020. Chinese automakers were able to undercut EV prices from foreign competitors also present in the Thai market, such as BMW and Mercedes, thereby appealing to a broader consumer base. In addition, the Thai government offers various financial incentives for electric cars, including subsidies, excise duty waivers and import tax reductions, which have contributed to making electric cars more attractive. Tesla is planning to enter the Thai market in 2023 along with building Superchargers.
In Indonesia, BEV sales multiplied by more than 14, exceeding 10 000, while PHEV sales remained close to zero. In March 2023, Indonesia announced 
new incentives
 to support sales of electric two-wheelers, cars and buses, with the aim of strengthening domestic capacity in EV and battery manufacturing through local component requirements. The government aims to subsidise the sale of 200 000 electric two-wheelers and 36 000 electric cars in 2023, reaching a sales share of 4% and 5% respectively. The new subsidies could reduce the price of an electric two-wheeler by 25-50% to help compete against ICE equivalents. Indonesia plays an important 
role
 in EV and battery supply chains, in particular given its abundant raw mineral resources and status as the world’s largest nickel miner. This has attracted investment from global companies, and Indonesia could become the 
largest
 manufacturing hub in the region for batteries and components.
Model availability remains an issue in EMDEs, with many of the options on sale heavily geared towards the higher end, such as SUVs, large and luxury models. While the trend for SUVs is global, purchasing power is more limited in EMDEs, making such vehicles largely unaffordable. Across the different regions considered in this section of the report, for a total of more than 60 EMDEs, including those which receive support from the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Global E-Mobility Programme, there were two to six times more large models available than small ones in 2022. 
In Africa, the best-selling electric car model in 2022 was the Hyundai Kona, a crossover BEV, and there were about as many recorded sales of Porsche’s large and expensive Taycan BEV as there were of Nissan’s medium-sized Leaf BEV. There were also eight times more sales of electric SUVs than of the Mini Cooper SE BEV and Renault Zoe BEV combined, the two best-selling small electric cars. In India, the best-selling electric car model was Tata’s crossover Nexon BEV, with over 32 000 sales, or three times more than the second best-selling model, Tata’s small Tigor/Tiago BEV. Across all of the EMDEs considered here, sales of electric SUVs reached 45 000, which is more than the sales of small (23 000) and medium (16 000) electric cars combined. In Costa Rica, the leading country in Latin America in terms of BEV sales share, only 4 models in the top 20 were not SUVs, and nearly a third were luxury models. The future of mass-market electrification in EMDEs relies on the development of smaller, more affordable electric cars, alongside two- and three-wheelers. 




















On the distinction between vehicle registrations and vehicle sales






An important distinction for assessing the evolution of vehicle markets is the difference between registrations and sales. New registrations represent the number of vehicles that have been officially registered for the first time with the relevant government ministry or insurance agency, including domestically produced and imported vehicles. Sales can either refer to vehicles sold by dealers or agencies (retail sales), or to vehicles sold to dealers by vehicle manufacturers (factory shipments, i.e. including exports). The choice of metric can make a significant difference when analysing vehicle markets. For consistency in accounting across all countries, and to avoid double-counting at a global level, in this report vehicle market sizes are based on new vehicle registrations, where available, and retail sales otherwise, not on factory shipments.
China’s vehicle market trends in 2022 are a good illustration of why this matters. In 2022, an 
increase of 7 to 10% in factory shipments
 (reported as sales) for the Chinese passenger car market was reported, while insurance registrations showed a stagnation of the domestic market in the same year. This increase was observed in data from the 
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers
 (CAAM), which is the official data source for China’s car industry. CAAM data is collected from car manufacturers and represents factory shipments. Another widely referenced source is the 
China Passenger Car Association
 (
CPCA
), a non-governmental organisation that provides wholesale, retail sales and exports for passenger cars, but is not qualified to provide national statistics, and it does not cover all OEMs, whereas CAAM does. The 
China Automotive Technology and Research Center
 (CATARC) is a state-owned think tank, and collects car production numbers from vehicle identification numbers and car sales numbers from vehicle insurance registrations. In China, vehicle insurance is registered for the vehicle itself and not for the individual driver, and is therefore useful for tracking the number of vehicles on the road, including imports. The main differences between CATARC data and the other sources stem from exports and military or other cars that do not get registered, and inventory stocks of vehicle manufacturers.
In 2022 the total exports of passenger cars increased rapidly, making the differences between these data sources more apparent. In 2022 
the export of passenger vehicles increased by almost 60%,
 exceeding 2.5 million, while the imports of passenger vehicles decreased by almost 20% (950 000 to 770 000). 
Similar discrepancies between factory shipments and insurance registrations are apparent in the Chinese bus and truck (commercial vehicle) market. In both 2021 and 2022, total volumes of factory shipments were substantially higher than insurance registrations, implying net export shares of commercial vehicles of about 9% in 2021 and more than 13% in 2022.

Sales of electric light commercial vehicles continue to increase, catching up with electric car sales






Electric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales worldwide nearly doubled in 2022 relative to 2021 to more than 310 000 vehicles, even as overall LCV sales declined by more than 10%. At a global level, the electric LCV sales share is 3.6%, about one-quarter that of passenger cars. Current trends indicate that the electric LCV market is catching up with that of electric cars, suggesting that the gap in terms of EV sales shares could narrow in the future. For the first time in 2022, the increase in the share of electric LCVs outpaced that of electric passenger cars (albeit from a low base). This demonstrates that once a 
critical tipping point
 in terms of favourability of total cost of ownership (TCO) has been achieved, commercial vehicle purchasers are likely to respond 
more rapidly
 to economic fundamentals than private consumers. Commercial vehicle owners typically use their vehicles more intensively, and as they have an imperative to maximise profit, EVs provide an opportunity to considerably reduce operating costs. The experience of commercial owners can also provide learnings for the private consumers segment: better fleet and charging management could help address concerns over range limitations.
The share of PHEVs in LCVs has remained very low; around 98% of both electric LCV sales and stock in 2022 were BEVs. It is likely that this reflects the economic favourability of the battery electric powertrain – as opposed to plug-in hybrids – in commercial operations characterised by intensive usage, regularity and predictability (in terms of driving range, geographic extent, and return-to-base for overnight charging), as well as the lower maintenance and service costs of battery electric LCVs. Battery electric LCV adoption may also be spurred on by the continuing expansion of low- and zero-emission zones.

In 2022, China led in terms of overall electric LCV sales with over 130 000 units sold, and nearly 15% of LCVs sold being electric.
7
 Subsidies for battery electric and fuel cell trucks and vocational vehicles (including LCVs) have decreased in recent years, but overall zero-emission commercial truck sales have been growing since 2020, even as subsidies per vehicle have declined, indicating the increasing commercial competitiveness of electric trucks. 
In terms of market share, Korea continued to lead in 2022 with 27% of LCV sales being electric (36 000 vehicles), but sales growth in 2022 slowed to half its level in the previous year. This may be due to 
changes
 to the subsidy scheme for LCVs and to the repealing in April 2022 of a policy that made obtaining commercial registration permits 
easier
 for electric LCVs than ICE models (see 
Policy developments and corporate strategy
).
Light commercial EV sales shares also grew substantially in the Nordic countries, with Norway reaching 25%, Iceland 16%, and Sweden 13%. In all other key European and North American national markets, shares are lower than 10%, and typically less than the global average of 3.5%, but the rate of growth in market share for electric LCVs was higher than for passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) (albeit from a lower baseline) across most leading EV markets, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union.















        Electric two- and three-wheelers
    














Electric two-wheeler sales declined in China while global electric three-wheeler sales continued to rise






Global electric two-wheeler sales totalled about 9.2 million in 2022, a drop of nearly 18% from 2021. This drop is almost entirely attributable to the dip in sales of electric mopeds and motorcycles in China, which fell from 10.2 million in 2021 to under 7.7 million in 2022, even as the overall two-wheeler market there continued to grow. Supply chain challenges stemming from China’s pandemic-related restrictions in 2022 hit the electric two-wheeler market particularly hard, and in spite of growth in sales of premium domestic and imported two-wheelers (e.g. from BMW, Ducati and others), the overall sales share of electric two-wheelers dipped back below 50%.
8
 Despite the decline in sales, China continued to dominate the electric two-wheeler market in terms of size, accounting for nearly 85% of global sales.
Electric two-wheelers also lost market share in Viet Nam, despite sales shares of domestically produced electric two-wheelers having 
increased considerably
 in recent years. In terms of absolute volumes, sales grew in most Asian markets outside China and Viet Nam.














India leads on sales of electric three-wheelers thanks to policy support and innovative business models






Sales of electric three-wheelers, which play an important role in urban mobility in India for both cargo and passenger services, soared to 425 000 units in 2022. Sales have been strong in India for a number of years, with hundreds of thousands of electric three-wheelers sold every year since 2012, with the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reduced sales volumes to 30% of the previous year.
Over half of India’s three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity due government incentives and lower lifecycle costs compared with conventional models, as well as higher fuel prices. IEA analysis on the TCO in India suggests that electric three-wheelers are already 70% cheaper than their gasoline-power ICE equivalents over their lifetime (IEA, forthcoming).
Policies including the purchase incentives under FAME II, supply-side incentives under the PLI scheme, tax benefits and India’s Go Electric campaign all contributed to reducing the higher upfront costs (see 
Policy developments and corporate strategy
 for a detailed discussion of these and other policies). A total of 
15 Indian states
 have already adopted EV policies to promote stronger EV deployment (and 
many more
 are drafting them), the majority of which include additional demand incentives. Bulk procurement schemes, the emergence of the battery-as-a-service (BaaS) business model and India’s draft battery swapping policy all give further impetus to the rapidly rising sales of electric three-wheelers.
China followed India in terms of electric three-wheeler sales, with nearly 350 000 units sold in 2022. Together, China and India accounted for nearly 99% of global electric three-wheeler sales.




















Korea continues to lead fuel cell electric car growth






In 2022, the stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased 40% compared to 2021, reaching over 72 000 vehicles globally. About 80% of the FCEVs are cars, 10% trucks and almost 10% buses. In 2022, the fuel cell truck segment grew at a faster rate than cars and buses, increasing 60%. 
Korea is now home to over half of all fuel cell cars globally. Two-thirds of the additional 15 000 fuel cell cars that hit the road in 2022 were in Korea. This can be attributed in part to a policy landscape that supports FCEV production and sales, which has also led to Hyundai being the top fuel cell automaker. 
The United States holds the second largest FCEV stock, with over 15 000 FCEVs. Most of these are fuel cell cars, with a little more than 200 fuel cell buses. In 2022, the stock of FCEVs in the United States increased more than 20%, which is much less than the 60% growth in China, which has the third largest FCEV stock.
Historically, China has dominated the heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle segments (trucks and buses). This is still the case in 2022, with China home to over 95% of the global fuel cell truck fleet and almost 85% of the global fuel cell bus fleet. However, in 2022, China added over 200 fuel cell cars to its FCEV fleet after years of only deploying buses and trucks.

Electric Vehicle Market Growth Dynamics:



Driver: Reducing prices of EV batteries will increase demand for EVs by making them cost effective



Due to technological advancements and the production of 
EV batteries
 on a mass scale in large volumes, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing during the past decade. This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade.



Restraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure



The initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time.



Opportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors



Increase in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022.



Challenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE)



The high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles.



Market Ecosystem







FCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period



The FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.



Mid-priced EV segment to be the largest market during the forecast period



A mid-priced vehicle is considered to have a price of USD 30,000 to USD 45,000. This vehicle class has limited features with low emphasis on features such as infotainment, instrument cluster, and other expensive features. China is one of the leading markets for the mid-priced segment. Established automotive manufactures such as Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, and Nissan are also manufacturing mid-priced EVs to acquire higher market shares. Some other mid-priced EVs include BMW 3 Series PHEV, Zeekr One, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40, Renault Megane EV, Hyundai  Ioniq 5, Volkswagen  ID 4, Kia  Niro EV, etc. In 2022, BYD Song Pro/Plus was the best selling mid-priced EV in Asia Pacific region, followed by Tesla Model 3 in Europe and North America. The EV Market forecast for the mid-priced segment is the largest in the Asia Pacific and European regions due to the demand for low-emission vehicles at reasonable prices. Various top EV models such as Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Mitsubishi Outlander, Volkswagen Passat, Hyundai Kona, etc. fall under this category. These were also some of the largest selling EVs in these regions excluding Tesla in 2022. Thus, the demand for mid-priced EVs has been high in the past few years and is expected to keep rising in the coming decade. The market in the MEA is expected to grow at the highest rate in this segment as there is expected to be rising new demand in this region for these vehicles in the next decade.



Asia Pacific to be the largest and the fastest growing market by value during the forecast period



The region is home to some of the fastest-developing economies, such as China and India. The governments of these emerging economies have recognized the growth potential of the EV Market trends and, hence, have taken different initiatives to attract major OEMs to manufacture electric vehicles in domestic markets. The region is home to 93 of the world’s most polluted cities, and has a high energy demand. As of 2022, transportation sector in the region accounts for around 14% of overall emissions. Thus, countries in the region, are planning to reduce emissions in the coming years. China, the e-mobility leader in the region, had set a target of over 20% EV sales by 2025, which it had already achieved in 2022 and is expected to have around 35% in 2023. Similarly, countries such as South Korea, Japan and India have also announced plans to shift to EVs in coming years. India for instance, plans to have 30% of its passenger car sales to be electric by 2030. South Korea and Japan are also aiming to be among the world’s top 5 EV producers by 2030. China is also investing significantly in the production of both electric passenger as well as commercial vehicles, with plans for export. OEMs such as BYD plan to open plants in other parts of the world to manufacture electric buses and electric trucks to meet regional demand. The country supports EV usage by offering a subsidy for buying EVs. The country is also encouraging manufacturers to develop better EV technology. Various EV charging stations are set up across the country due to the subsidy for setting up EV infrastructure. The country has promoted the development and use of EV buses and trucks. In 2020, a low-cost EV passenger car, Wulin Hongguang Mini EV, was developed in China, costing less than USD 5,000. The vehicle sold majorly in the domestic market, but its gross sales were the second highest of the total EV sales in 2022. The demand of Mini-EVs has been growing in the country, with more choices available with other leading Chinese manufacturers entering the mini-EV space. Luxury EVs have also increased in demand in the country, with major domestic OEMs in China have grabbed the EV Market share. According to various official estimates, the market share is expected to be around 35% of the total vehicle market in 2023.

The study involved four major activities in estimating the current size of the electric vehicle market. Exhaustive secondary research was done to collect information on the market, the peer market, and the child markets. The next step was to validate these findings, assumptions, and sizing with the industry experts across value chains through primary research. The top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed to estimate the complete market size. Thereafter, market breakdown and data triangulation processes were used to estimate the market size of segments and subsegments.



Secondary Research



In the secondary research process, various secondary sources such as company annual reports/presentations, press releases, industry association publications [for example, publications of electric vehicle manufacturers, International Energy Agency (IEA), Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC), European Alternate Fuels Observatory (EAFO), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), country-level vehicle associations and trade organizations, and the US Department of Transportation (DOT)], EV related magazine articles, directories, technical handbooks, World Economic Outlook, trade websites, government organizations websites, and technical articles have been used to identify and collect information useful for an extensive commercial study of the global EV Market.



Primary Research



Extensive primary research has been conducted after acquiring an understanding of this market scenario through secondary research. Several primary interviews have been conducted with market experts from the demand- and supply-side OEMs (in terms of component supply, country-level government associations, and trade associations) and component manufacturers across four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa. Approximately 23% and 77% of primary interviews have been conducted from the demand and supply side, respectively. Primary data has been collected through questionnaires, emails, LinkedIn, and telephonic interviews. In the canvassing of primaries, we have strived to cover various departments within organizations, such as sales, operations, and administration, to provide a holistic viewpoint in our electric vehicle market report.



After interacting with industry experts, we conducted brief sessions with highly experienced independent consultants to reinforce the findings from our primaries. This, along with the in-house subject matter experts’ opinions, has led us to the findings as described in the remainder of this report. Following is the breakdown of primary respondents.

Market Size Validation



The top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the electric vehicle market by drive type and top speed in terms of volume.



The top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the EV Market. In this approach, key drive and top speeds of electric vehicles are identified for each propulsion type (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) at the country-level. The penetration of each identified drive type and top speed type for each propulsion type is multiplied with the volume of each vehicle at the country-level to derive the total volume. All country-level data is summed up to derive the global market by drive and top speed type.







Data Triangulation



After arriving at the overall market size—using the market size estimation processes as explained above—the market was split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the overall market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation, and market breakdown procedures were employed, wherever applicable. The data was triangulated by studying various factors and trends from both the demand and supply sides.



Market Definition



An electric vehicle is an automobile propelled by one or more electric motors. An electric vehicle uses energy stored in rechargeable batteries, which can be charged using private or public charging infrastructure. There are four major types of electric vehicles, namely, battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV).
