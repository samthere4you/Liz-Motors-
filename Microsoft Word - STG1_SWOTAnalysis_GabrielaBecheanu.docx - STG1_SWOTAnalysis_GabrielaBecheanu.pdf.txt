CANOO
 
SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengt
h
s
Innovation
 
One of the key strengths of Canoo is
 
continuous
 
innovation
 
which is supported by its strong R&D facilities which allow
s
it to develop
 
unique
 
products
.
 
The strong R&D helped in building strong Intellectual Property as Cano
o
 
has
 
ongoing
 
various patents
applications
 
on its innovations.
One
 
System Various
 
Design
 
The heart of the Canoo system is its “skateboard” architecture, which houses the batteries and the
electric drive
 
train in a chassis underneath the vehicle’s cabin. All of the company’s vehicles will have
 
the unconventional design that
takes advantage of the flatter structure, a skateboard platform, that will offer a skeleton to multiple electric vehicle comp
onents
st
acked atop it and a more significant cabin space
 
for different applications
 
centered around minimalism and functionality
.
Technology
 
Simplicity
 
Canoo’s vehicle design embraces a harmony between
 
the technology
 
style and utility
.
 
B
eneath this
exquisite design
 
drivers will use their own phones or tablet devices
 
as the vehicle’s primary interface
 
to handle things like music
and
 
navigation, and even to control the vehicle's heating and air conditioning using a downloadable app.
 
to give
ultimate
 
performance
.
Sustainable
 
Financially
 
Subscribers would pay a monthly fee that could include registration costs, insurance, maintenance
and charging costs.
 
Customers would keep their vehicle, as with a lease, but they wouldn't have to commit to a
 
set time period.
 
This
becomes really beneficial and hassle free for the drivers.
Value
 
Rather than operating through retail auto dealers, Canoo will deal
 
with customers directly using mobile apps and
websites
 
to deliver an authentic experience
. The company won't sell its cars should help it avoid the sort of legal
 
conflict
s with
established auto dealers
.
Consumer
 
focus
 
Canoo
 
designs its
 
products
 
with a focus on consumers while keeping their mind in the future. They always try to
imagine the things which even the
 
consumer has not imagined yet
.
 
Canoo has developed break
h
trough electric vehicles, reinventing

the a
u
tomotive landscape with bold innovations in design, pioneering technologies, and a unique business model that defies
traditional ownership to put customer
 
first.
Weaknesses
B
rand valuation
 
Canoo
 
is going public at a valuation of $2.4 billion in an effort to raise enough money to help bring its first
multi purpose
 
vehicle
 
‘loft on wheels’
, so the brand equity is currently low
.
Matching
 
Customer expectations
 
Being
 
one of the EV
 
compan
ies that went public, listed on the stock market
 
has the
 
consumer
expectation
 
going through the roof. People expect great things year after year and maintaining these expectation levels is not easy
for anyone.
Dependency on few products
 
Canoo
 
has only
 
3
 
product
s
 
in its
 
portfolio
 
set
 
to launch
 
in comparison to the various products that
its closest competitors
 
on the EV market
 
. Hence the dependency of
 
Canoo
 
on each of its products is very high. If one product fa
ils,
then that is a
 
high
 
loss to
 
the brand
. Hence, there is a common
 
demand
 
from
 
Canoo
 
to increase its
 
product portfolio
.
Opportu
nities
Growth
 
in Universal Consumer Electric Vehicle
 
market
 
Electric
 
Vehicle
 
Market
 
is
 
projected to reach 26,951,318 units by 2030
from an estimated 3,269,671 units in 2019, at a CAGR of 21.1% This is primarily driven by
 
the concern over greenhouse gas emissions
and their contribution to global warming
, dissatisfaction with the ICEV
.
Reasear
ch&Development Worlwide
 
for energy storage, infrastructure that provides new, green technologies, zero emissions
 
and
improvements in battery technology.
Time
 
Canoo has one more year ahead untill the first model to be launched on the market.
 
Therfore, this time could be used to
produce and provide the elements and teqniques that were not yet ready before Covid19 impact and the initial launching date i
n
2021.
