Electric Vehicle Trends
An increasing number of governments and businesses are pledging to achieve carbon neutrality within the next few decades. The electrification of vehicles is a big component of this plan.

What are the latest vehicle electrification trends?
How will the automotive industry contribute to the global goal of carbon neutrality?  


































The auto industry's transition to EVs is accelerating. The year 2026 has emerged as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption that will drive automotive electrification trends ahead. By 2030 over one in four new passenger cars sold will be an electric vehicle. Many major vehicle manufacturers worldwide have signaled the end of an era of internal combustion engines (ICE) as the transition to zero emission vehicles (ZEV) is ramped up.
The top automakers are expected to account for more than 70% of global EV production by the year 2030 (compared to 2022 when they represented only 10% of all EV manufacturers). But despite the rapidly growing choices EV consumers have, and the unprecedented loyalty rates among EV return buyers, the industry as a whole still needs to tackle consumers range anxiety, particular for those without a garage or those traveling long distances.
The solution needs to be a joint effort between multiple industries: automotive, utilities, government, and private property owners such as shopping malls and apartment complexes. As these paths converge, vehicle electrification trends will increase exponentially. And we may, indeed, see the end of the ICE-age.

FAQs






What is the future of the EV market?




S&P Global Mobility has significantly revised up its EV penetration rate forecasts. The forecasts for global BEV passenger car production based on our September 2022 powertrain forecast are 41 million in 2030—approximately 42% of total global production of 97 million cars.




What is the trend of electric vehicles?




The EU has the strongest regulatory pressure and shows the highest OEM ambition to phase out the internal combustion engine vehicles. About 64% of passenger cars sold in 2030 will be a battery electric vehicles compared with 55% in the previous forecast setting of first quarter 2021.




What are the major risks to the EV market outlook?




Risks to EV adoption include shifting policy environments, the emerging interplay between consumer and OEM, and the cost profile of battery electric vehicles versus internal combustion engine vehicles.




When will EV adoption accelerate?




The year 2026 emerges as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption with more than one in four new passenger cars produced will be an electric vehicle.
