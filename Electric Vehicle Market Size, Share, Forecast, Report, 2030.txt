Electric Vehicle Market Growth Dynamics:



Driver: Reducing prices of EV batteries will increase demand for EVs by making them cost effective



Due to technological advancements and the production of 
EV batteries
 on a mass scale in large volumes, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing during the past decade. This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade.



Restraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure



The initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time.



Opportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors



Increase in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022.



Challenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE)



The high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles.



Market Ecosystem







FCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period



The FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.

The study involved four major activities in estimating the current size of the electric vehicle market. Exhaustive secondary research was done to collect information on the market, the peer market, and the child markets. The next step was to validate these findings, assumptions, and sizing with the industry experts across value chains through primary research. The top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed to estimate the complete market size. Thereafter, market breakdown and data triangulation processes were used to estimate the market size of segments and subsegments.



Secondary Research



In the secondary research process, various secondary sources such as company annual reports/presentations, press releases, industry association publications [for example, publications of electric vehicle manufacturers, International Energy Agency (IEA), Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC), European Alternate Fuels Observatory (EAFO), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), country-level vehicle associations and trade organizations, and the US Department of Transportation (DOT)], EV related magazine articles, directories, technical handbooks, World Economic Outlook, trade websites, government organizations websites, and technical articles have been used to identify and collect information useful for an extensive commercial study of the global EV Market.



Primary Research



Extensive primary research has been conducted after acquiring an understanding of this market scenario through secondary research. Several primary interviews have been conducted with market experts from the demand- and supply-side OEMs (in terms of component supply, country-level government associations, and trade associations) and component manufacturers across four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa. Approximately 23% and 77% of primary interviews have been conducted from the demand and supply side, respectively. Primary data has been collected through questionnaires, emails, LinkedIn, and telephonic interviews. In the canvassing of primaries, we have strived to cover various departments within organizations, such as sales, operations, and administration, to provide a holistic viewpoint in our electric vehicle market report.



After interacting with industry experts, we conducted brief sessions with highly experienced independent consultants to reinforce the findings from our primaries. This, along with the in-house subject matter experts’ opinions, has led us to the findings as described in the remainder of this report. Following is the breakdown of primary respondents.

Market Size Validation



The top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the electric vehicle market by drive type and top speed in terms of volume.



The top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the EV Market. In this approach, key drive and top speeds of electric vehicles are identified for each propulsion type (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) at the country-level. The penetration of each identified drive type and top speed type for each propulsion type is multiplied with the volume of each vehicle at the country-level to derive the total volume. All country-level data is summed up to derive the global market by drive and top speed type.







Data Triangulation



After arriving at the overall market size—using the market size estimation processes as explained above—the market was split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the overall market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation, and market breakdown procedures were employed, wherever applicable. The data was triangulated by studying various factors and trends from both the demand and supply sides.



Market Definition



An electric vehicle is an automobile propelled by one or more electric motors. An electric vehicle uses energy stored in rechargeable batteries, which can be charged using private or public charging infrastructure. There are four major types of electric vehicles, namely, battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV).
