Canoo Competition Correlation Matrix
Typically, diversification allows investors to combine positions across different asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk. Correlation between Canoo and its competitors represents the degree of relationship between the price movements of corresponding stocks. A correlation of about +1.0 implies that the price of Canoo and its corresponding peer move in tandem. A correlation of -1.0 means that prices move in opposite directions. A correlation of close to zero suggests that the price movements of assets are uncorrelated; in other words, the historical price movement of Canoo Inc does not affect the price movement of the other competitor.
