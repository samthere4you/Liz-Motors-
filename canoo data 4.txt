The Business Combination

On December 21, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (“HCAC”) consummated the previously announced merger pursuant to that certain Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated August 17, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among HCAC, HCAC IV First Merger Sub, Ltd., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a direct, a wholly owned subsidiary of HCAC (“First Merger Sub”), EV Global Holdco LLC (f/k/a HCAC IV Second Merger Sub, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of HCAC (“Second Merger Sub”), and Canoo Holdings Ltd., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands (“Legacy Canoo”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between HCAC and Legacy Canoo was effected through the merger of (a) First Merger Sub with and into Legacy Canoo, with Legacy Canoo surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HCAC (Legacy Canoo, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the merger, the “Surviving Corporation”) and (b) the Surviving Corporation with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub being the surviving entity, which ultimately resulted in Legacy Canoo becoming a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of HCAC (all transactions collectively, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date December 31, 2021, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, HCAC changed its name to Canoo Inc. and the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GOEV.

Legacy Canoo was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805. While HCAC was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Legacy Canoo was deemed the accounting acquirer, for accounting purposes, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of Legacy Canoo (i.e., a capital transaction involving the issuance of stock by HCAC for the stock of Legacy Canoo). Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of Legacy Canoo became the historical financial statements of the combined company, and HCAC’s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with Legacy Canoo, upon the consummation of the Business Combination. The net assets of HCAC are recognized at historical cost (which is expected to be consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.3

The increase was primarily due to increases in research and development costs of $92.5 million and salary and related benefits expense of $38.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $33.6 million. The increase in research and development costs primarily is related to expenditures for the Gamma stage engineering design and development costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Salary and related benefits expenses increased $38.8 million, from $48.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $87.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases are primarily due to continued investment in personnel and contract employees to drive and reach the company’s research and development goals.

The decrease in stock-based compensation expenses of $33.6 million was primarily driven by the restricted stock awards modified and issued during the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was largely due to $58.7 million of stock-based compensation incurred in 2020 related to the modification of the performance restricted stock awards to time-based vested awards with a merger trigger, which was satisfied on December 21, 2020, partially offset by the recognition of stock compensation expense related to issuance of awards to employees during the year ended December 31, 2021.

The remaining increase was primarily driven by the continued recognition of stock compensation expense, resulting from the modification of certain performance restricted stock awards to become time-based vesting with a merger trigger, which was satisfied on December 21, 2020.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased by $10.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to interest expense incurred and the amortization of debt discount on related party convertible notes that were repaid in connection with the Business Combination.

    Innovative electrical systems architecture

“Canoo Digital Escosystem” is being developed by the company which should serve as a major point of differentiation between Canoo and its competitors. The application will give opportunity to the customers to connect all their Canoo vehicles throughout the lifecycle of them, and a raw data opportunity of 1-2 terabytes per day. A core value proposition of the offering is its ability to centralize and analyze data from not only Canoo vehicles, but all other vehicles, across multiple owners. The ecosystem aims to collect data over-the-air from Canoo and other connected vehicles, and via an OBD device from non-connected vehicles. The company will package some functionalities with the vehicle, while others are expected to be offered as upgradeable options which may be purchased or accessed as a subscription service. In addition, Canoo plans to assess partnerships with third-parties for certain services accessed through their software, such as financing or insurance. The Canoo Digital Ecosystem, designed to offer long-term return on capital for customers, will leverage this data to power a vehicle lifecycle management platform, delivering an improved customer journey.6

As a part of the manufacturing strategy, the company has decided to locate its production plants in America to engage with the communities that are investing in high tech, and innovative manufacturing alongside them and to create American jobs as well. It will use manufacturing technologies such as 3D-printing, and flexible machinery and equipment. Currently, Canoo has secured commitments with the states of Arkansas and Oklahoma for manufacturing, R&D, software development and customer support and finance facilities. The company is in the process of completing definitive agreements with both states including approximately $400 million of non-dilutive financial incentives. It intends to have an advanced industrialization facility located in Bentonville, Arkansas, capable of producing vehicles at low volume. By initiating production of vehicles in the advanced industrialization facility in Bentonville, the company will also be able to validate and test their processes in advance of starting scaled production at their high-volume commercial production facility in Pryor, Oklahoma.

Canoo Inc. has revealed the MPDV in December, 2020 and the Canoo Pickup in March, 2021. The research and development team of the company is developing prototypes of Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles which will pave the ways for MPDV, Canoo Pickup and other derivatives of Lifestyle Vehicle. To achieve an overall five-star US New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”) crash rating, the company has conducted thousands of computer-aided engineering (“CAE”) crash simulations.

The company expects to offer direct sales through their website for fleets, individuals, and volume orders. They are also exploring vehicle sales through alternative distribution channels, including physical retailers and online sales platforms, which may offer access to existing markets and sales channels, reduce capital expenditure, and allow for more rapid and seamless expansion to new markets, both urban and non-urban. The company expects to generate more revenue from the sale of its aftermarket products. Canoo Digital Ecosystem will also be another source of revenue for the company. Subscription models will be handed out to the customers for using premium features. For service and maintenance, the company plans to develop their own service facilities or to operate via third-party partnerships where possible, so that owners of our vehicles can receive fast and seamless service wherever they are.
Market Opportunity

The market for Electric Vehicles can be broadly categorized into two segments – passenger and commercial applications. The global call for clean energy has spurred the governments pass laws to move from gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles market. Since 2018 Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has been publishing reports on projection on the EV adoption. As the years have passed, the company has revised the sales projection of EVs in 2030. In 2018 report of BCG, the projection was 21% and in 2022 report, the project is revised to achieve CAGR of 53% year-on-year. BCG’s 2022 report was published in June of 2022, months before the new tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (signed August 2022) and California’s proposed ban on the sale of gasoline vehicles in 2035 (announced August 2022). These developments will continue to expedite EV adoption in the US, promising that the next BCG report will have more aggressive projections.7

electric vehicles trend

The commercial market segment for Canoo supposedly has huge opportunity in it. The last mile delivery vehicles are expected to be into the market keeping a same pace with the growth of the ecommerce. According to eMarketer, the North American e-commerce market is projected to grow at a 18.4% CAGR (between 2019 and 2025), reaching approximately $1.6 trillion in scale by 2025. Further, the transition of existing and new last mile delivery fleets to all EVs is expected to be a significant trend in the short-term period, according to McKinsey. According to Bloomberg NEF, light duty commercial vehicles, such as last mile delivery vehicles, will be the first commercial vehicles to transition to electric, as compared to medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles.

electric vehicle adoption trend

According to Bloomberg NEF, global sales of new passenger EVs are expected to grow from 2.7% of total vehicle sales in 2020 to 10% and 58%, in 2025 and 2040, respectively. Consumers, facing the growing threat of climate change and becoming more confident in improved EV range and the broader expansion of EV charging infrastructures, are increasingly looking to an EV as their next vehicle. Consumers in urban areas, in particular, have shown the highest levels of demand. Demand for passenger EVs in the United States, specifically, is expected to grow quickly at a 26% CAGR from 2019 to 2028 and reach over 3 million EVs on the road by 2028, according to EVAdoption. Potential significant upside in the consumer EV segment remains as the penetration of EVs in the United States as a percentage of total annual consumer vehicle sales is expected to still be under 3% in 2022, according to data from Bloomberg NEF, presenting substantial growth potential for our consumer vehicle offerings.
Competitive strengths

    Differentiated digital ecosystem is considered by the company to be a major source of competitive advantage. 
    The company will offer aftermarket services throughout the lifetime of the vehicles. Incremental opportunities can arise from their durable MPP, adaptable top hats, customizable connected accessories, automotive service-related software offerings and over-the-air upgrades.
    The in-house engineered and designed platform can give the company a competitive advantage.
    The ecosystem is built as a software-centric one, which can provide harmonized vehicle data services and monetization opportunities.
    The company also reports its experienced leadership with a long track record of success and deep expertise in automotive vehicle lifecycle technologies as its competitive advantage.
